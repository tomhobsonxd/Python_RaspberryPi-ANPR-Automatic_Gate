ANPR (Automatic Number Plate Recognition) using OpenCV (opencv-python) for image processing and Tesseract (pytesseract) for OCR
***
### Installation

The steps below assume you already have Python installed. I am using Python 3.8 for this example as it is the most up-to-date at the time of creation.

#### OpenCV-Python & Tesseract

##### Open-CV-python

To install the opencv-python libraries, run:

`pip install opencv-python`

Then install imutils using,

`pip install imutils`

##### Tesseract & pytesseract

###### Windows

Follow the guide from here: [Tesseract at UB Mannheim](https://github.com/UB-Mannheim/tesseract/wiki)
