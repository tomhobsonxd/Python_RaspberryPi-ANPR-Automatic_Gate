## Python ANPR using OpenCV

ANPR (Automatic Number Plate Recognition) using OpenCV (opencv-python) for image processing and Tesseract (pytesseract) for OCR

### Installation

The steps below assume you already have Python installed. I am using Python 3.8 for this example as it is the most up-to-date at the time of creation.

#### OpenCV-Python & Tesseract

First run: 'pip install opencv-python'
